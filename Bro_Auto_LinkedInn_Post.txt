🚀 Exciting Mini Project: Browser Automation for Microsoft Rewards Points! 🎯

I’m thrilled to share my recent mini project on browser automation that I’ve developed to help users earn Microsoft Rewards points effortlessly! 🎉

This project consists of two key parts:

### 🖥️ Part 1: Python Script for Automation 
I created a Python script that:
1. Performs manual and automated searches to earn Microsoft Rewards points.
2. Allows users to select from:
   - Manual searches
   - Automated searches by fetching top trending topics through an API 📈
3. Users can set the number of searches (1-20) to earn points! 🔍💻

The script includes:
- Installation of necessary dependencies like selenium, beautifulsoup4, and requests.
- Setting up Microsoft Edge and MS Edge WebDriver for automation.
- A streamlined process for running the script on Parrot OS. (Windows installation coming soon!) 🖥️

### 🌐 Part 2: GitHub Pages Website
Along with the script, I’ve developed a GitHub Pages website that:
- Guides users on how to set up the automation script on Parrot OS.
- Displays an interactive login page (just for fun!) with an old-school Microsoft XP screen for nostalgia. 🖥️⏳
- Includes clear installation instructions with screenshots of Parrot OS and commands for easy setup.
- A Copy Button for easy command copying, improving the UX/UI. 💡

🔗 What's on the Website:
1. Initial Microsoft XP screen (for 3 seconds!) for a nostalgic touch before transitioning to the login page.
2. Login screen requesting email to continue (just for fun!).
3. OS selection page where users can click Parrot OS to view the guide for setting up the automation script.
4. Step-by-step instructions with screenshots for smooth setup. 👨‍💻

### ⚙️ Challenges & Learnings
One of the challenges I encountered was ensuring compatibility with different OS environments, but with a bit of troubleshooting and research, I was able to create a seamless experience for Parrot OS users. It was a rewarding process to make this automation accessible and user-friendly!

### 🔧 Future Plans/Improvements
In the future, I plan to enhance the script’s automation capabilities and make it compatible with more platforms, including Windows. Stay tuned for updates! 🚀
