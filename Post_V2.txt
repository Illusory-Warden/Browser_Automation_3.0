🚀 Exciting New Project: Browser Automation for Microsoft Rewards Points - Browser_Automation_3.0 🎯

Hello LinkedIn community! 👋

I’m excited to share a mini project I’ve been working on called Browser_Automation_3.0! It’s a Python script that automates searches for the Microsoft Rewards program, helping users effortlessly earn points! 💻💰

🖥️ Project Overview:
This project has two major components:
1. Python Script for Automation:
   - The script performs manual and automated searches to earn Microsoft Rewards points.
   - Users can manually choose their search topics or let the script fetch top trending topics from an API and automatically perform the searches. 📈
   - Users can specify the number of searches they want to perform (from 1 to 20) to accumulate points, making it very flexible! 🔍

2. GitHub Pages Website for Easy Setup:
   - To make setting up the script as easy as possible, I’ve created a GitHub Pages website that walks users through the entire process of getting everything up and running on Parrot OS.
   - The website starts with a fun Microsoft XP screen that appears for 3 seconds before transitioning to a simple login page. Then, users can choose their OS, and clicking on Parrot OS leads to a step-by-step guide for installation.
   - Each installation step comes with screenshots of Parrot OS and the necessary commands to set up the environment. A Copy Button is included to make command copying easy for users! ✂️💡

🔧 Why This Works Together:
While the Python script automates the Microsoft Rewards process, the GitHub Pages website ensures that users can get everything set up without any hassle. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or a beginner, the website’s user-friendly interface and clear instructions will guide you through the installation process step by step.

🌟 Future of This Project & New Website Features:
Moving forward, I plan to upload all my future projects to this GitHub Pages website. So, users will be able to select the next project they want to explore, just like they did with Browser_Automation_3.0! 🎉 This will make it easy for anyone to access all my projects in one place, no matter what technology or programming language they focus on.

As I continue building new tools, automation scripts, and more, the website will serve as a central hub for my work, helping both beginners and advanced users set up and use these projects with ease. 🚀

For now, Browser_Automation_3.0 is fully developed and working on Parrot OS, but I’m actively working on making it compatible with Windows in the near future. Stay tuned for updates! 📢
